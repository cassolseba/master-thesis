	abstract = {We increasingly interact with multiple interactive artifacts with overlapping capabilities during our daily activities. It has previously been shown that the use of an interactive artifact cannot be understood in isolation, but artifacts must be understood as part of an artifact ecology, where artifacts influence the use of others. Understanding this interplay becomes more and more essential for interaction design as our artifact ecologies grow. This paper continues a recent discourse on artifact ecologies. Through interviews with iPhone users, we demonstrate that relationships between artifacts in artifact ecologies cannot be understood as static, instead they evolve dynamically over time. We provide activity theory-based concepts to explain these dynamics.},

	abstract = {Assuming that an interactive artifact cannot be fully understood by itself due to their increasing number, we explored how individual artifacts are related to each other and how those relationships can be investigated for further design and research implications. This study suggests a concept of ecology of artifacts to describe any implicit or explicit relationships among interactive artifacts in one's personal life. We conducted two types of studies -- personal inventory study and an ecology map study -- to explore multiple dimensions for understanding a personal ecology of artifacts. We expect the knowledge of artifact ecology would help designers and researchers in the field of HCI to create and analyze interactive artifacts considering their dynamic interplays in an increasingly ubiquitous technology environment.},

Especially the widespread adoption of the Everything as a Service (*aaS) model of delivering software and (virtualized) hardware through cloud computing has put two sustainability dimensions upfront and center. On the one hand, services must be sustainable on a technical level by ensuring continuity of operations for both providers and consumers despite, or even better, while taking into account their evolution. On the other hand, the prosuming of services must also be financially sustainable for the involved stakeholders.},

In this paper, we present an action-research process that facilitates the use of digital commons among a group of participants. The process core aspect is understanding our participants’ interests and values to present multiple off-the-shelf tools fitting their needs. In doing so, we leveraged on Artifact Ecologies, using them as an action-research tool. The process is articulated in three main phases: 1) we engaged participants in a reflection on their Artifact Ecologies, connecting the artifacts in use to their values; 2) we used these results to selected valuable digital commons; 3) we presented these tools to the group, connecting them to participants’ ecologies. At the end of the process, we performed a collective interview to evaluate the process alongside assessing the adoption of the proposed technologies. Based on our findings, we developed five tactics to foster digital commoning.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of remote education and work in universities due to COVID-19, the `zoomification' of higher education, i.e., the migration of universities to the clouds, reached the public discourse. Ongoing discussions reason about how this shift will take control over students' data away from universities, and may ultimately harm the privacy of researchers and students alike. However, there has been no comprehensive measurement of universities' use of public clouds and reliance on Software-as-a-Service offerings to assess how far this migration has already progressed. We perform a longitudinal study of the migration to public clouds among universities in the U.S. and Europe, as well as institutions listed in the Times Higher Education (THE) Top100 between January 2015 and October. We find that cloud adoption differs between countries, with one cluster (Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland) showing a limited move to clouds, while the other (U.S., U.K, the Netherlands, THE Top100) frequently outsources universities' core functions and services -- starting long before the COVID-19 pandemic. We attribute this clustering to several socio-economic factors in the respective countries, including the general culture of higher education and the administrative paradigm taken towards running universities. We then analyze and interpret our results, finding that the implications reach beyond individuals' privacy towards questions of academic independence and integrity.},

A large part is driven by proprietary digital products and services developed and offered by for-profit companies that form the education technology industry. This article aims to introduce a theoretical focus of rentiership and assetization into the study of the political economy of education technology. It discusses five potential transformations that the education sector is undergoing as a consequence of digital rentiership. These transformation address new rentee and potential rentier roles of education institutions, nestedness of digital platforms and their terms of use, a rise of contractual governance within the education sector, re-institutionalising the sector, and tensions between competition and monopoly in digital education markets. These trends are not exhaustive and represent only the start of the analysis on rentiership in education. The paper concludes with an invitation for future research.},

It reviews methods of assessing the direct and indirect impact of ICT systems on energy and materials demand, and examines the results of such assessments. In addition, it investigates ICT-based approaches to supporting sustainable patterns of production and consumption, analyzing them at various levels of abstraction – from end-user devices, Internet infrastructure, user behavior, and social practices to macro-economic indicators.
Combining approaches from Computer Science, Information Systems, Human-Computer Interaction, Economics, and Environmental Sciences, the book presents a new, holistic perspective on ICT for Sustainability (ICT4S). It is an indispensable resource for anyone working in the area of ICT for Energy Efficiency, Life Cycle Assessment of ICT, Green IT, Green Information Systems, Environmental Informatics, Energy Informatics, Sustainable HCI, or Computational Sustainability.},

	abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic and the social distancing that followed have affected all walks of society, also education. In order to keep education running, educational institutions have had to quickly adapt to the situation. This has resulted in an unprecedented push to online learning. Many, including commercial digital learning platform providers, have rushed to provide their support and 'solutions', sometimes for free. The Covid-19 pandemic has therefore also created a sellers' market in ed-tech. This paper employs a critical lens to reflect on the possible problems arising from hasty adoption of commercial digital learning solutions whose design might not always be driven by best pedagogical practices but their business model that leverages user data for profit-making. Moreover, already before Covid-19, there has been increasing critique of how ed-tech is redefining and reducing concepts of teaching and learning. The paper also challenges the narrative that claims, 'education is broken, and it should and can be fixed with technology'. Such technologization, often seen as neutral, is closely related to educationalization, i.e. imposing growing societal problems for education to resolve. Therefore, this is a critical moment to reflect how the current choices educational institutions are making might affect with Covid-19 education and online learning: Will they reinforce capitalist instrumental view of education or promote holistic human growth? This paper urges educational leaders to think carefully about the decisions they are currently making and if they indeed pave the way to a desirable future of education.},

On the other hand, the maintainability index has been proposed to calculate a single number that expresses the maintainability of a system. In this paper, we discuss several problems with the MI, and we identify a number of requirements to be fulfilled by a maintainability model to be usable in practice. We sketch a new maintainability model that alleviates most of these problems, and we discuss our experiences with using such as system for IT management consultancy activities.},

Physicalmeasurements are often rare in software engineering, except in afew niches. One such important niche is that of software energyconsumption, green mining, green IT, and sustainable computing, which all fall under the umbrella of green software engineering. With the physical measurement of energy consumption comesall of the limitations of measurement and experimentation thatexist in the natural sciences and engineering. Issues abound, fromattribution of energy use, isolation of components, to replicableexperiments. These get further complicated by cloud computingwhereby systems are virtualized and attribution of resource usageis a serious issue. Thus in this work we discuss the current state of softwareenergy consumption, and where will it go.},

	abstract = {The three-pillar conception of (social, economic and environmental) sustainability, commonly represented by three intersecting circles with overall sustainability at the centre, has become ubiquitous. With a view of identifying the genesis and theoretical foundations of this conception, this paper reviews and discusses relevant historical sustainability literature. From this we find that there is no single point of origin of this three-pillar conception, but rather a gradual emergence from various critiques in the early academic literature of the economic status quo from both social and ecological perspectives on the one hand, and the quest to reconcile economic growth as a solution to social and ecological problems on the part of the United Nations on the other. The popular three circles diagram appears to have been first presented by Barbier (Environ Conserv 14:101, doi: 10.1017/s0376892900011449, 1987), albeit purposed towards developing nations with foci which differ from modern interpretations. The conceptualisation of three pillars seems to predate this, however. Nowhere have we found a theoretically rigorous description of the three pillars. This is thought to be in part due to the nature of the sustainability discourse arising from broadly different schools of thought historically. The absence of such a theoretically solid conception frustrates approaches towards a theoretically rigorous operationalisation of ‘sustainability’.},

	abstract = {This book brings together diverse voices from across the field of sustainable human computer interaction (SHCI) to discuss what it means for digital technology to support sustainability and how humans and technology can work together optimally for a more sustainable future.
Contemporary digital technologies are hailed by tech companies, governments and academics as leading-edge solutions to the challenges of environmental sustainability; smarter homes, more persuasive technologies, and a robust Internet of Things hold the promise for creating a greener world. Yet, deployments of interactive technologies for such purposes often lead to a paradox: they algorithmically "optimize" heating and lighting of houses without regard to the dynamics of daily life in the home; they can collect and display data that allow us to reflect on energy and emissions, yet the same information can cause us to raise our expectations for comfort and convenience; they might allow us to share best practice for sustainable living through social networking and online communities, yet these same systems further our participation in consumerism and contribute to an ever-greater volume of electronic waste.By acknowledging these paradoxes, this book represents a significant critical inquiry into digital technology’s longer-term impact on ideals of sustainability.
Written by an interdisciplinary team of contributors this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of human computer interaction and environmental studies.},

	abstract = {We explore the idea of objects that, under some contextual conditions, become less “agreeable” to the user. Such an object may lower its performance level, become less usable, or start producing discouraging stimuli. Yet, it always remains fully functional and usable. We call such objects resistive. We describe three ways, in which making an object resistive may add value to the user. The resistive object may offer feedback on the user's past improper actions. It may encourage the user to improve her behavior at the moment. Or, it may offer the user an instant, discouraging evaluation of a bad operation on the object, which she is about to perform. In each case, resistivity is meant to help the user avoid undesirable behavior and choose a better course of action. In the paper we introduce the concepts of personal and community-wide resistive objects and provide a model of object resistivity. We exemplify the concepts with a number of ideas for resistive objects. 'otably, the examples may serve as an inspiration for quite a few experiments with end users. Finally, we hint at selected research issues.},

In light of this, universities have to capitalise on the Internet for teaching, and one progressive development of this is the use of online delivery methods. This paper draws upon the results of a survey conducted amongst students enrolled in one online management course at an Australian university. Three critical success factors in online delivery are identified: technology, the instructor and the previous use of the technology from a student’s perspective. We also argue that the lecturer will continue to play a central role in online education, albeit his or her role will become one of a learning catalyst and knowledge navigator.},

To cater to the needs of this new generation of students, HE institutions increasingly adopt digital tools such as virtual learning environments (VLE) and social media (SM). Little is known, however, about the impact of these digital technologies on students' HE outcomes. Drawing from service productivity theories, this study aims to address this gap. Through exploratory sequential mixed research methods, we identify five HE outcomes and reveal that Learning-Oriented Outcomes are the most important in HE even when digital technologies are not used; and these outcomes are further enhanced when students use VLE. Learning-Oriented Outcomes, however, are the least important when SM is used in HE; students tend to prioritise outcomes related to Knowledge Transfer instead. Our research findings derive theoretical and practical contributions and open up avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {Digital technologies have been developed for postgraduate students to help them to access data and published research, write their dissertations, and communicate with their supervisors. In South Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic has compelled masters students to make greater use of digital technologies to ensure continuity and productivity under government-imposed lockdown at home. In previous studies, students have been observed to use digital technologies to address professionalisation or socialisation experiences at the expense of personalisation experience. This qualitative case study of five master’s students explores their experiences of using digital technologies during the COVID-19 lockdown. The participants were purposively selected from a larger sample of 14 students who participated in the researcher’s doctoral study. Semi-structured interviews, focus group discussion and questionnaire methods were conducted with the participants, and inductive (thematic) analysis, in conjunction with deductive analysis (using the Persona-Tech analytical framework proposed in this study) was used to analyse and interpret the data. The findings revealed that some participants were aware of their personal research needs, and were able to identify digital technologies suitable for their studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the process of knowing and understanding their research needs, the participants became problem-centred and be able to tolerate uncertainty caused by COVID-19. These participants emphasised convenience and continuity. However, other participants experienced the unsystematic introduction of these digital technologies as a barrier to usage. This study suggests that researchers combine their socialisation and professionalisation experiences of using technology to create a personalisation experience that addresses their individual research needs.},

Digital technologies have emerged as an essential tool to achieve this goal. These technologies are simple to detect emissions sources, prevent additional damage through improved energy efficiency and lower-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels, and even remove surplus greenhouse gases from the environment. Digital technologies strive to decrease or eliminate pollution and waste while increasing production and efficiency. These technologies have shown a powerful impact on the education system. The recent COVID-19 Pandemic has further institutionalised the applications of digital technologies in education. These digital technologies have made a paradigm shift in the entire education system. It is not only a knowledge provider but also a co-creator of information, a mentor, and an assessor. Technological improvements in education have made life easier for students. Instead of using pen and paper, students nowadays use various software and tools to create presentations and projects. When compared to a stack of notebooks, an iPad is relatively light. When opposed to a weighty book, surfing an E-book is easier. These methods aid in increasing interest in research. This paper is brief about the need for digital technologies in education and discusses major applications and challenges in education.},

It is possible to obtain information easily from any institution through the Internet; in fact, the first impression of an organization an individual perceives is almost always based on its official website. Services related to education are increasing worldwide; therefore, it is important that users, regardless of their disabilities, be able to access these websites in an effective manner. However, the homepages of universities in Latin America still do not meet web accessibility criteria. This paper describes the problems of web accessibility identified in 348 main university websites in Latin America according to their rankings on Webometrics. The results show that the universities' websites have frequent problems related to the lack of alternative image text. It was found that the university websites included in the present study violate Web accessibility requirements based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. The many problems identified concerning Website accessibility indicate that it is necessary to strengthen Web accessibility policies in each country and apply better directives in this area to make Websites more inclusive.},

Several tech-based solutions –including virtual training and tutoring, discussion forums, access to content and information, collaborative platforms, and Open Educational Resources (OER)– were implemented to address this shift and continue to be used in the post-pandemic era due to the advantages they offer, especially for hybrid and blended learning. However, the implementation of these tech-based solutions also revealed several accessibility issues that need to be addressed to fully leverage the technological benefits. This study aims to provide a framework to facilitate the adoption of good practices related to technological accessibility in virtual Higher Education. The implementation of the framework is divided into four basic actions, each of which should be tailored to the constraints and needs for improving accessibility in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The framework's instantiation in four HEIs serves as a proof-of-concept in real-world scenarios. The preliminary results suggest that the proposal is promising, as it was adaptable to the specific needs of each HEI fostering accessibility and inclusion through technological alternatives that align with their organisational structures and current levels of attention to accessibility.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In order to support a wide range of applications and services, data centers are crucial components of contemporary computer infrastructure. Nevertheless, the rapid expansion and functioning of these entities have resulted in notable energy usage and ecological consequences. Power usage effectiveness, dependability, and operating costs are all impacted by electricity supply systems, which are crucial to the operating and energy efficiency of data centers. This review article offers a thorough summary of the state of the art in data center power supply systems research, covering case studies, best practices, developing technologies, and potential directions for future investigation. The study begins with a survey of energy-efficient data centers and an outline of power usage effectiveness design concerns. The categorization of electricity supply systems is discussed through various integration strategies with renewable sources of electricity generation. This includes identifying scenarios where data centers operate in countries with a 100\% fossil fuel electricity matrix, strategies for implementing clean energy purchase contracts, and investments in both on-site and off-site renewable energy projects. The review of the literature addresses current research on data center power systems, emphasizing significant discoveries and patterns in the field while pointing out gaps and restrictions. The assessment also looks at new developments in energy storage, power management, and renewable energy integration. The research, which draws from case studies of effective energy supply systems in data centers, offers useful suggestions and best practices for planning, executing, and overseeing data center power systems. The paper ends with recommendations for further study and application.},

	abstract = {Data centres consume high levels of energy to power the IT equipment contained within them, and extract the heat they produce. Because of the industry's heavy reliance on power, data centre metrics have historically used operational efficiency as a proxy for sustainability. More recently the industry has begun to recognise that its focus needs to go beyond energy consumption, with the creation of metrics for issues such as carbon, water and compute efficiency. However, single-issue metrics often consider only the operational phase, omitting impacts from other issues, during other stages in a facility's lifetime. Further approaches exist to assess more holistically the impact of data centres, such as building environmental assessment methods, but none have the capacity to capture fully the interlinked nature of a system, where improvements in one area and to one impact, can adversely affect a totally different area and totally different impacts. The following review of literature summarises the approach of the data centre industry to environmental impact, and provides direction for future research. Part 1 describes the energy consumption of the ICT industry and in particular data centres; current knowledge on the environmental impact of the industry; and how single-issue metrics have risen to prominence.},

	abstract = {The crises societies face today contribute to a rather challenging life setting that demands in-depth reflection, daring new thinking, and change urgently. Transformative education for a sustainable future is needed today more than ever before; the aim of this paper is an exploration of its goal and pedagogy. By drawing on diverse bodies of knowledge, including the structure-agency debate and the theory of critical pedagogy, this paper critically discusses Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and its goal of sustainable development. It identifies areas where ESD needs enhancement given the present socio-economic and cultural context and ultimately proposes the transformation of ESD to Education for Eco-communities—which highlights the need for community-centered approaches, knowledge, and observation of natural laws, sociological imagination, and political acumen—to render it better suited for the challenges of the 21st century.},

	abstract = {Information and communications technologies (ICTs) are increasingly available, even in developing countries, leading to a number of pressing questions. Will ICTs for education (ICT4E) improve learning and educational quality? Might they increase the ‘digital divide’ with negative consequences for equity? What can ICT4E offer to help assist in the achievement of the new UN Sustainable Development Goals? The present review addresses these questions and uses of ICT4E in developing countries. First, a short overview is provided of how ICT4E intersects with the learning outcomes and the quality of education, including contemporary perceptions of what does and does not work in ICT4E. Second, an ICT4E framework is suggested as a way to reconceptualize the parameters currently in use that will lead to more effective ICT4E design solutions. Third, ICT projects in four key education subsectors – early childhood, basic and secondary education, and teacher education – help to disaggregate where and how interventions have been made in recent years. Finally, a set of investment domains in ICT4E is described, along with a set of specific suggestions to advance the field. The paper concludes with the suggestion that measurable, sustainable, and scalable design solutions in ICT4E are the best way to assist in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.},

	abstract = {Electronic waste is one of the main environmental problems caused by the consumption’s dynamics. E-waste disposal is concerning all the stakeholders, from policymakers to the end users. Hence, an assessment of the overall sustainability of e-waste, considering the three pillars: environmental, economic, and social, is an important task. Higher education institutions are called to adopt sustainable development strategies in order to give a positive impact on the community. In this work, the assessment of the program of selective collection of electronic waste, called Recyclatron, implemented at Universidad Autónoma de Nayarit, in Mexico, is presented. The objective of such program is to promote a culture toward sustainability in e-waste management at university campus, as well as, be a reference for social and environmental responsibility from community. The quantity of e-waste picked up during the four times in which Recyclatron was carried out, demonstrate an exponential growth trend, matching well with the equation \$\$y = A\{{\textbackslash}text\{e\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{{\textbackslash}frac\{x\}\{t\}\}\} + y\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{o\}\}\$\$. A total amount of 28,836.00 kg of electronic waste has been collected since the first time of Recyclatron, avoiding that electronic waste was finally disposed in the municipal landfill. According to the trend equation, the quantity of e-waste will increase up to near 60,000 kg for the next edition of Recyclatron. Finally, the stakeholder methodology used for the logistical process of Recyclatron resulted in a high level of participation and the awareness of stakeholders which was fundamental part of the success of this work.},

The study aims to increase transparency about the energy consumption of the ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) sector, and to evidence the behavioural factors best suited to influence and to reduce its adverse impacts. Specifically, the scope of the study is to shed light on the too-often forgotten energy impact of ICT by providing a comprehensive overview of existing published estimates relating to the energy consumption of day-to-day digital actions and services, establishing simple and accurate estimates of the energy consumption for a limited number of these actions and services (ten in total), and creating communication materials for the purpose of disseminating these results via various communication channels. In doing so, this study gathers and provides evidence to help the European Commission identify mechanisms to address and mitigate the issue of ever-increasing energy consumption of the ICT sector, while achieving the RePowerEU Plan’s and European Green Deal’s objectives.},
